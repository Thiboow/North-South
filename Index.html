            <h1>Cinephile? France is Made for You</h1>
            <h2>Paris, Paris, always Paris.</h2>

            <p>Paris makes people dream. In this city, triumphant monuments put stars in the eyes of visitors from
                around the world. Arches don’t shoot arrows—they leave memories. Cathedrals don’t creak under the
                weight of time or flames; they are filled by the warmth of millions of visitors. Culturally, Paris
                holds an invaluable place in both national and international influence. 36.3 million tourists visited
                the capital in 2024… 102 million across all of France—maybe you were one of them? In terms of culture,
                France tops the charts as the most cinema-loving country in Europe, with 181.3 million admissions in
                2024. Paris ranks fourth globally for the total number of cinemas, but first in density, with nearly
                three cinemas per square kilometer—five times more than New York, the second on the list, far behind.
                Yet, under the shadow of the Iron Lady, there’s a region also full of cinemas, each with its own
                influence and audience. In the world’s most visited country, it’s essential to distinguish between
                the capital and the rest of the French departments.</p>

            <h2>Numbers that Tell a Different Story</h2>
            <div class="div-flexconteneur">
                <div class="flex-items-1">
                    <p>Let’s take a concrete example: the departments of Loire and Haute-Loire. Together, they cover
                        nearly
                        9,758 km²—almost a hundred times the size of Paris (105 km²). Yet, there are only about forty
                        cinemas
                        across these two territories, while the capital boasts over 300. In other words, in Paris,
                        there’s a
                        cinema every 350 m², whereas in Loire + Haute-Loire, you have to cover an average of 226 km² to
                        find
                        one. These numbers seem ruthless: Paris concentrates the offer, while the countryside makes do
                        with
                        crumbs. But stopping at this simple comparison would be a mistake. Rural cinemas have their own
                        identity, often bold programming, and a capacity to unite audiences that many urban multiplexes
                        would
                        envy.</p>

            <p>Exploring this map, you’ll notice cinemas scattered along valleys and around small towns, sometimes
                isolated but firmly rooted in their territories. Some cover influence areas spanning tens of
                kilometers, attracting audiences from communes with no other cultural options.</p>

            <div id="Coeur Du Sujet">
                <h2>Human-Scale Cinemas, Unique Programming</h2>
                <p>In these cinemas, there are no endless lines or overly long ads. They screen independent films,
                    documentaries, and foreign works often absent from Parisian billboards. Festivals, special
                    screenings, and director Q&As transform the venue into a true cultural hub. Data even shows that a
                    cinema’s catchment area isn’t always correlated with its number of seats. On average, cinemas in
                    Haute-Loire have 287 seats, those in Loire 501, but some mid-sized hubs (50,000 to under 200,000
                    inhabitants) reach over 1,100 seats. Paradoxically, some larger urban areas cap around 800.</p>

                <div class="div-flexconteneur">
                    <div class="flex-items-2">
                        <img id="DataViz1" src="images/Dataviz/DataViz 1 - Porportion Habitants_Sièges.png"
                            alt="Seats per population proportion">
                    </div>
                    <div class="flex-items-2">
                        <p>This chart illustrates the proportion of seats available in cinemas relative to the number of
                            inhabitants. Using Haute-Loire as a baseline (index 100), Loire shows a marked contrast. It
                            has about 3.4 times more inhabitants but nearly 6 times more cinema seats. In short: Loire
                            is not only more populated but also better equipped to host audiences. This disparity
                            reveals a more generous per-capita cinema offer than its neighbor, confirming that cinema
                            placement also follows a logic of density and cultural attractiveness. It would be naive to
                            assume that more seats guarantee better screenings. A small rural cinema can surprise with
                            bold programming, while an urban multiplex mainly plays the volume game.</p>

                <h2>An Invitation for Traveling Cinephiles</h2>
                <p>For visiting New Zealand cinephiles, these cinemas are more than a mere backup plan. They offer an
                    immersive experience where a movie outing can be combined with a hike in the Loire gorges or a
                    stroll through the Auvergne volcanoes. Their architecture, sometimes housed in former theaters
                    or industrial buildings, adds a heritage touch that extends the magic of the screening. By
                    supporting these cinemas, you also contribute to the local economy for cafes, restaurants, and
                    neighborhood bookstores thrive in sync with screenings. It’s another way to travel like slower,
                    more human, and closer to the locals.</p>

                <h2>The Big Screen Beyond Big Cities</h2>
                <p>Paris will always be Paris, the capital of lights and projectors. But Loire and Haute-Loire remind
                    us that beyond the numbers, French cinema thrives far from the boulevards. So, on your next visit
                    to France, let the interactive map guide you to one of these rural cinemas because you’ll discover
                    films
                    unavailable elsewhere and a living piece of French culture, far from the usual tourist clichés.</p>
